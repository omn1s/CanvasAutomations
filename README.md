# CanvasAutomations
A set of Powershell utilities designed for the administration of the Canvas LMS.

# Overview
Primarily, I wrote these functions to assist with SIS Data import, so this code assumes you have your SIS exporting users/terms/courses/sections/enrollments already. I've included a few extra functions just for monitoring SIS importing that may not need any access to the data CSVs to be useful.
